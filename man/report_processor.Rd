\description{
Makes reports for LTMV typically used for auto reports such as
subscriptions, dispatchments and bulletins. As such, please be warned that
any changes to this function might render existing auto reports nonfunctional
as they are based on static calls based on any previous version of this
function. Changes should therefore be thoroughly tested against existing auto
reports. Altering the names of the arguments will likely be a breaking
change. Adding new arguments should be safe as long as they are provided a
default value.
